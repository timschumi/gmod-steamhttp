# gmod-steamhttp

This project aims to provide an open-source drop-in replacement for GMod's
built-in HTTP module. It provides the same interface as the original to
allow for replacing it easily. In comparison to CHTTP, this module is based
on Steam's HTTP backend (ISteamHTTP).

## To Valve

In the case that me including the Steamworks headers/binaries violates some
license or anything, please let me know. I haven't been able to find any
information about that yet, but I'll happily take them down in case there are
any issues.
