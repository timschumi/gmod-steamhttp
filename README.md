**WARNING:** This project is deprecated. It rarely works, has been out of date
for a long time, and now that [CHTTP](https://github.com/timschumi/gmod-chttp)
does not require manually installing dependencies anymore, there is no need to
start maintaining this again. The repository and its releases will stay
publicly accessible, but unless you have a _really good_ reason for it, you
should use CHTTP instead.

# gmod-steamhttp

This project aims to provide an open-source drop-in replacement for GMod's
built-in HTTP module. It provides the same interface as the original to
allow for replacing it easily. In comparison to CHTTP, this module is based
on Steam's HTTP backend (ISteamHTTP).

## To Valve

In the case that me including the Steamworks headers/binaries violates some
license or anything, please let me know. I haven't been able to find any
information about that yet, but I'll happily take them down in case there are
any issues.
